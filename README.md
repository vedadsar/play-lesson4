BitCamp demo app for play
=================================

<h1> Version 1 </h1>

Currently the app contains what we have covered in the past week doing Play!.
You can find a user model and post model with some naive security implemented.
Take a not of partial views such as navigation.scala.html, _userForm.scala.html and _postForm.scala.html.
You will see some inconsistency in handling some functionality, this is bad in the general case but here it server
to expose different ways to achieve the same thing.
